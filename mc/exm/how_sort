When you want to sort a database do the following:

- Put a EOF-Cell at the bottom of the database-range
  (Simply by entering "EOF" into the cell under the
   left-bottom cell of the database-range)

- Pipe the database through "sort" by entering a command like:

  'B2>sort -t"	" +3 >/tmp/sorteddata'
   |          |
   |          > this is a <tab> since mc pipes tabs between the columns!
   > upper-left-most database cell

  into any free cell of the worksheet

- Once you entered the command into a cell, the database-range
  starting with B2 (in this example) until the "EOF"-cell will
  be piped into the command 'sort -t"	" +3 >/tmp/sorteddata'.
  Which meens the database-range is sorted on the third column
  and written into the file "/tmp/sorteddata".

- Pipe the sorted database back into the worksheet
  by entering a command like:

  'B2<cat </tmp/sorteddata'
  
  into any other free cell of the worksheet.

- You can reexecute the commands simply by editing (by F2 or !)
  the cells with the commands and pressing ENTER.
